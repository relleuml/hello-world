# hello-world
Just another respository - 
Hello,
Over the last few years I've been self-learning a number of new programming languages and technologies. I have enjoyed working with iOS and Xcode completing the Big Nerd Ranch books on Objective-C and iOS Programming. I have also been learning Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, finding Python the most interesting for me. Previously I have worked through exercises and tutorials on C and Java. Thanks for reading this README file. Take care and good luck in your programming journeys.
Thanks.
